# Decoding the memory map

Reading the memory map with MODBUS style telemetry commands in UF mode, either with a Logic Analyzer or with the GUI python script

## Reading the memory map with trial and error

Address | Confirmed function
--- | ---
00 | control bits, low byte corresponds to gear and lamp status
09 | Acceleration response (16-bit val)
0a | Brake response (16-bit val)
20 | maximum speed (km/h*0.1)
26 | battery voltage (V*0.1)
27 | battery amperage (A*0.01)
28 | temperature (read only high-byte, Â°C)
29 | various control bits, unknown except for gear select and lamp status
2F..30 | total kilometers (read-only, km*0.001)

## writing something to memory

Recreating my old total kilometer record of approx. 1000 km before a firmware upgrade destroyed it, resetting it to zero:

target value=1000.000 km=0x000f4240

writing location 0x002f=0x4240: `01 17 00 2f 00 01 00 2f 00 01 02 42 40 53 3b`

writing location 0x0030=0x000f: `01 17 00 30 00 01 00 30 00 01 02 00 0f 11 a5`

...was unsuccessful. It looks like the memory for the total km's is write protected, which is good, but won't help me restore my original 1000 km record.
